# Members only

## About
This is the assignment from the [Odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication). The application is about authentication and authorization. The web site is a
"cloub house" of members, where members can post and everyone can see the posts. The catch is,
only the members can see the author ov any given post, and the rest of the members can only see
the content. 

## Testing
You may want to play around with the application, since making the user sign up page was 
not part of the assignment, users have been manually added to the data base. In order to 
see the user perspective you may login as one of the users.
